    <p class="con">FAVORITES: My favorite website mostly are social media and online streaming websites. Examples of my favorite social media websites are Facebook and Twitter. I used
        these websites for reading news, viewing memes, viewing different artworks and for communicating with families and friends. Also I like to watch online shows such
        as anime, movies and series. The websites that i like watching online are Animepahe and Animixplay for anime because it is a free website to watch anime. For watching
        movies and series I choose Netflix because it offers a large amount of shows as well as shows that are only exclusive in netflix that are really good.</p>
